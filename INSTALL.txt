First of all clone the repository into some directory:
git clone https://github.com/dstokovsky/cargo.git

Then you should install pip package manager for python and python and mysql development 
packages because some data from them is necessary for MySQL-python package:
 - su -c 'yum install python-devel yum install mysql-devel.i686 mysql-devel.x86_64'

Then we could install virtualenv to limit the work environment
pip install virtualenv

If it has been already installed then create the new env and activate it:
virtualenv cargo
source cargo/bin/activate

To exit current env just execute in shell:
deactivate

For proper work of application the next packages should be installed in the
project environment:
pip install django
pip install djangorestframework
pip install django-filter
pip install markdown
pip install -U distribute>=0.6.28
pip install MySQL-python

Don't forget to create database and add its credentials to cargo/settings.py.
Also after applying api/sql/database.sql the next one should be executed in 
mysql shell to give the opportunity to run tests:
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON test_cargo.* TO 'cargo'@'localhost';

To check out the app:
python manage.py runserver

To run tests:
python manage.py test
